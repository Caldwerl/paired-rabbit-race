#Paired Rabbit vs Turtle Race

####Description

In this simulation, the rabbit and the turtle will race against eachother over a user determined distance.
Users will be able to input attributes to both the rabbit and the turtle to see how different attributes
will change the results of the race.

####Development Plan
1. No JS popups will be used.
2. Name and description of the simulation will be in the HTML tags
3. Below that, there will be a race settings form for users to tweak the animals
4. Once user submits the settings and confirm, the settings form will be replaced with the progress of the race
5. Progress of the race will repeat until one animal reaches the proper distance.
